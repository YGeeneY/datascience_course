**cumsum**
didnt show to much a lot of noise to much data to see through noise **pretty sure I've build plot wrong**


**comments_articles_daily** actually you can see a peak at 10am and slight 8pm - 1am

**cooments_articles_weekly** slight curve starts from monday and downgrade to weekends

**both above plots shows that there is some 1to1 correlation between articles count and comments count**

**article_comment_correlation** is displaying it
